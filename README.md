Toggl Target
============

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/6cc811c7d497451486079451ec0fbeb6)](https://app.codacy.com/app/mosab-a-ibrahim/toggl_target?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mos3abof/toggl_target&utm_campaign=badger)

At work, we track our working hours on Toggl (www.toggl.com), so I created this small project to calculate how many hours I should work to achieve my monthly goals.

You will need to install `requests` and `dateutil` python libraries to be able to use this.


Installation on linux
---------------------

If you are using linux, you most probably have Python already installed on your machine.
If not, use your distro's package management system to install Python 2.7

* Download and extract the source code from [here](https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target/archive/master.zip)
* Navigate to the extracted directory and run the following command to install the required packages :

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Copy `config.py-example` to `config.py`
* In `config.py` add your Toggl API token, which can be found in your Toggl account's settings.
* Change other values in `config.py` to match your case

Installation on Windows
-----------------------

* If you don't have Python installed, then you must install Python 2.7 from [here](http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/python-2.7.5.msi)
* Open the Windows command shell
* In the command shell, run the following commands

```
python distribute_setup.py
easy_install pip
pip install python-dateutil requests
```

* Download toggl_target from [here](https://github.com/mos3abof/toggl_target/archive/master.zip)
* Extract the downloaded zip file, copy `config.py-example` & paste it as `config.py` beside `run.py`
* Change your API key in `config.py` Your Toggl  API token can be found in your Toggl account's settings.
* Run `python run.py`

Usage
-----

To use the script run the following command :

```
$ python run.py
```

The output will be something like :

```
Hi
Checking Internet connectivity...
Internet seems fine!

Trying to connect to Toggl, hang on!

So far you have tracked 120.00 hours

Business days left till deadline : 7
Total days left till deadline : 10

Required working hours for this month : 170

To achieve the minimum :
    you should log 4.00 hours every business day
    or log 3.00 hours every day

To achieve the required :
    you should log 7.00 hours every business day
    or log 5.0 hours every day

So far you have achieved:

70.59% [=================================================--------------|------]
```

You can also filter by workspace name's (-w / --workspace), client's name (-c / --client) or project's name (-p / --project), using the following command :

```
$ python run.py -w Work
```

Optionally, you can choose a number of days (-d / --days) left to reach your target, and see the remaining number of hours per day, using the following command :

```
$ python run.py -w Work -d 10
```
